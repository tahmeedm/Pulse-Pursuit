## Inspiration
"Pulse Pursuit" emerged from the captivating idea of merging physiological responses with interactive gameplay. We were drawn to the exhilarating nature of horror games and saw an opportunity to enhance this with the use of a live heart rate monitor, creating a unique and immersive gaming experience.

## Game Concept
**Genre**: Horror-themed RPG  
**Core Mechanic**: In "Pulse Pursuit", the player's real-time heart rate dictates the pace of both the player character and a pursuing horror entity, creating a dynamic and responsive gameplay experience.

## Gameplay Overview
Players embark on a thrilling adventure through various haunting environments, such as dense forests, spooky abandoned houses, and eerie basements. The live heart rate monitor makes the player's physical reactions central to gameplay. Elevated heart rates increase the speed of both the player and the pursuer, intensifying the chase, while lower heart rates provide strategic pauses but with increased risk.

### Objectives
- **Primary Objective**: Outlast and survive the relentless pursuit of the horror entity.
- **Secondary Objectives**: Engage in tasks such as collecting items, harnessing power-ups, and navigating a maze of rooms and obstacles.

### Gameplay Dynamics
- **Touchables**:
  - *Spiketrap*: Temporarily slows progress.
  - *Pill Bottles*: Provides a speed boost.
  - *Open Door*: Transitions to new and haunting environments.
- **Interactables**:
  - Engage with objects like levers within the game.
- **Obstacles**:
  - Encounter various hindrances including Barricades, Tables, Beds, Chairs, Boxes, Trees, Bushes, and Rocks.

## Visual and Audio Design
"Pulse Pursuit" features dark, atmospheric visuals and a dynamic soundtrack that adapts to the player's actions. Key auditory elements include flashlight shakes, lever clicks, and varying footsteps. Visual cues such as lever animations contribute to the immersive horror experience.

## Development

### Prerequisites
To run "Pulse Pursuit," you will need Python version 3.10 or above. Additionally, the game utilizes the Pygame library. Before running the game, ensure you have pygame-ce installed. You can install pygame-ce using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame-ce
```

Developed using Python and the Pygame library, "Pulse Pursuit" integrates a live heart rate monitor as a core gameplay mechanic. This technical integration required extensive Python programming and a deep dive into game development challenges.

## Challenges and Learnings
We encountered challenges in harmonizing the gameplay mechanics with the input from the heart rate monitor. This project broadened our understanding of Python game development and the integration of unique input devices, leading to innovative gameplay mechanics and immersive audio-visual synchronization.

## Proud Accomplishments
Our proudest achievement is the seamless integration of the heart rate monitor into the game, creating an experience that physically and emotionally engages the player in real-time.

## What's Next for Pulse Pursuit
We aim to further develop "Pulse Pursuit" by adding more diverse environments, enhancing gameplay mechanics, and exploring multiplayer capabilities. We are also considering adapting the game for web platforms to increase its accessibility and reach.

### Summary
"Pulse Pursuit" stands as a groundbreaking experiment in fear and strategy, blending physical and virtual responses in an immersive RPG horror setting. Each heartbeat and moment of tension or calmness shapes the player's journey, making "Pulse Pursuit" a testament to nerve and composure in a world of virtual terror.
